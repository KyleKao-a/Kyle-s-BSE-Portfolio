# Posture Corrector
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:
```HTML

# Starter Project: Handheld Retro Arcade

TEST The Handheld Retro Arcade is mostly for Soldering practice as I had to solder almost all parts of the console onto the main frame. This included soldering the Buttons, 12mm Passive Buzzer, 2d LED dot matrix moldule, Micro USB, Copper column, etc. Essentially how it works is that by using either the batteries or the micro USB we are able to power the IC Chip that is attatched to the main frame. With the Arcade now powered, by pressing the buttons we send signals via wires on the main frame to the IC Chip. With the Signals, the IC Chip will proccess the inputs and translate the input into an output that shown through the LED dot matrix Module that was also soldered onto the main frame and will then light up specific dots which is how the player will view the game. For Example, this is how the console is able to translate you pressing the right button into actions like moving the tetris piece to the right as the button press sends a signal onto the IC Chip which translates the signal into an action onto the LED Matrix, which allows the player to see that the tetris piece moves to the right.

A Challenging aspect of this project is definately Soldering the many components of the Arcade console since i'm rather inexperienced with soldering so the smaller holes were definately a challenge. I also had difficulties intially as I failed to follow instructions properly and had to restart the project in the beginning. 

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
